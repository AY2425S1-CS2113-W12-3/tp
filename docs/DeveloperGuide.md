## Acknowledgements

WheresMyMoney uses the following libraries

1. [OpenCSV](https://opencsv.sourceforge.net/) - Used for saving/ loading expenses

WheresMyMoney uses the following tools for development:

## Design & implementation


Design and Implementation has been broken down into various sections, each tagged for ease of reference:

- [UI and Parser](#ui-and-parser)
- [Commands](#commands)
- [Expense and Expense List](#expense-and-expense-list)

### UI and Parser

<u>Overview</u>

The Ui class handles I/O operations such as displaying messages and reading user input.
The Parser parses user input and returns the relevant Command Object. 
Both these classes are important for allowing the User to interact with the application.

<u>Methods</u>

The `Ui` class has the following key methods:

| Method           | Description                   |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| `displayMessage` | Displays a message (`String`) |
| `getUserInput`   | Reads User Input              |

The Parser class has the following key method:

| Method                 | Description                                               |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `parseInputToCommand`  | Parses a given user input and returns the related Command |

<u>Design Considerations</u>

Low-level I/O operations (eg. stdio) are consolidated in the Ui class such that we can easily switch the I/O methods by 
modifying only the Ui class. This would make it easier to port the application to other platforms if needed.

Ui class is used as part of exception handling for displaying of error messages to the user for feedback.

### Commands

#### Overview

The abstract Command class has been implemented to introduce an additional layer of abstraction between I/O and command execution, allowing for separation of handling command keywords and executing commands.


<u>Implementation Details</u>

The following diagram is an inheritance diagram for Command and its children classes. 
This has been heavily simplified and only shows the key commands.

The following diagram is a sequence diagram for execution of Command.

### Expense and Expense List

<u>Overview</u>

The `Expense` class represents an individual expense with a price, description, category and the date added.

The `ExpenseList` class manages a collection of `Expense` objects. 
It allows for the addition, editing and deletion of expenses.

<u>Methods</u>

The `Expense` class has no notable methods.

The `ExpenseList` class has the following key methods: 

|     Method      |            Description            |
|:---------------:|:---------------------------------:|
|  `addExpense`   |    Adds an expense to the list    |
| `deleteExpense` | Removes an expense from the list  |
|  `editExpense`  |   Edits an expense in the list    |

The following diagram is a class diagram for Expense and ExpenseList:

### Date and Time Handling

The `DateUtils` class provides utility methods to handle date formatting, validation and conversion.

The `DateUtils` class has no notable methods.

### Exceptions and Logging

<u>Overview</u>

The program implements Exception handling and Logging with the WheresMyMoneyException and Logging classes.

<u>Implementation Details</u>

WheresMyMoneyException has various children classes, such as `StorageException` and `InvalidInputException`. 
These children classes are meant to provide more information on the error to the developer (beyond the message) such 
that exception handling in the program could be better targetted in the future.

The Logging class is implemented as a Singleton for ease of use. 
Developers can log down certain actions in the program by simply calling the relevant class method `log(Level, String)`.

## Product scope

### Target user profile

Our target user profile is frugal and tech-savvy university students.

### Value proposition

The application will track how much a user is spending and what they are spending it on. 
The application can provide summaries and statistical insights to spending habits, optimised for people who prefer a CLI.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. Technical Requirements: Any mainstream OS, i.e. Windows, macOS or Linux, with Java 17 installed.
2. Project Scope Constraints: The application should only be used for tracking. It is not meant to be involved in any form of monetary transaction.
3. Project Scope Constraints: Data storage is only to be performed locally.
4. Quality Requirements: The application should be able to be used effectively by a novice with little experience with CLIs.
