### Architecture
A high-level overview of the system is shown in the Architecture Diagram below.

![ArchitectureDiagram.png](diagrams%2Fimages%2FArchitectureDiagram.png "Architecture Diagram of WheresMyMoney")

This architecture consist of: 
1. `UI`, `Main`, `Parser`, and `Command` classes: These classes stand between the user and the internal processing of the software.
2. `Expense`, `ExpenseList`, `ExpenseFilter` classes: Model expenses that commands can interact with.
3. `Storage` class: Stores information between sessions.
4. Logger and other utility classes: Provide extra functionalities for the software.
### UI and Parser

<u>Overview</u>

The Ui class handles I/O operations such as displaying messages and reading user input.
The Parser parses user input and returns the relevant Command Object. 
Both these classes are important for allowing the User to interact with the application.

<u>Methods</u>

The `Ui` class has the following key methods:

| Method           | Description                   |
|------------------|-------------------------------|
| `displayMessage` | Displays a message (`String`) |
| `getUserInput`   | Reads User Input              |

The Parser class has the following key method:

| Method                 | Description                                               |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `parseInputToCommand`  | Parses a given user input and returns the related Command |


<u>Design Considerations</u>

Low-level I/O operations (eg. stdio) are consolidated in the Ui class such that we can easily switch the I/O methods by 
modifying only the Ui class. This would make it easier to port the application to other platforms if needed.

Ui class is used as part of exception handling for displaying of error messages to the user for feedback.

The Parser also has some considerations such as
1. Restricted arguments which should not be used by other developers in their commands. These include
    1. `/command` -> used for the main command keyword
    2. `/main` -> used for the main text argument right after the command keyword
3. Any duplicate arguments will throw an InvalidInputException
4. All `/` in the argument values should be escaped
    1. Examples
       1. `command /argument \/value` -> `argument`: `/value`
       2. `command /argument value\/value` -> `argument`:`value/value`
       3. `command /argument value/value` -> `argument`:`value/value` (this is accepted for now, but not recommended)
       4. `command /argument value\\/value` -> `argument`:`value\/value`
   2. `/` doesn't need to be escaped for
       1. commands -> e.g. `/command /argument value1` -> the command is `/command`
           1. It is discouraged to do so, but the option is left for potential expandability
       2. arguments -> e.g. `command /argument/param value` -> the argument name is `argument/param`
    3. Leading and Trailing spaces are ignored, but additional spaces within values (eg. `main  value`) are counted 

### Commands

#### Overview

The abstract Command class has been implemented to introduce an additional layer of abstraction between I/O and command execution, allowing for separation of handling command keywords and executing commands.


<u>Implementation Details</u>

The following diagram is an inheritance diagram for Command and its children classes. 
This has been heavily simplified and only shows the key commands.

![CommandInheritance.png](diagrams%2Fimages%2FCommandInheritance.png)


The following diagram is a sequence diagram for execution of Command.

![CommandExecutionSequence.png](diagrams%2Fimages%2FCommandExecutionSequence.png)

Commands interact with `UI` and `Parser` classes via `Main`, as illustrated in the following class diagram:

![UiToCommand.png](diagrams%2Fimages%2FUiToCommand.png)

### Storage

<u>Overview</u>

Majority of the storage handling occurs in the ExpenseList class. 
This is to keep the storage tightly coupled with the expense data and ensures that when the expense list is updated,
the storage format is updated accordingly.

OpenCSV is used for the storage format to allow for reliable handling of CSV files. 
The CSV file format was used to allow expenses to be easily exported/ imported to and from other programs (like Excel).

In the future, if the state expands to be greater than an ExpenseList, it would be better for a separate class to be
created for solely handling Storage. 

The list of categories in ExpenseList and the corresponding spending limit set for each of those categories can also be saved to storage.

### Expense and Expense List

<u>Overview</u>

The `Expense` class represents an individual expense with a price, description, category and the date added.

The `ExpenseList` class manages a collection of `Expense` objects. 
It allows for the addition, editing and deletion of expenses.

<u>Methods</u>

The `Expense` class has no notable methods.

The `ExpenseList` class has the following key methods: 

|     Method      |            Description            |
|:---------------:|:---------------------------------:|
|  `addExpense`   |    Adds an expense to the list    |
| `deleteExpense` | Removes an expense from the list  |
|  `editExpense`  |   Edits an expense in the list    |

<u>Design Considerations</u>

The setters in `Expense` class checks for null and blank.
The `Expense` constructors also do, as they use those setters.

The `ExpenseList` class contains exception handling when attempting to edit or delete an expense that is not in the list.

<u>Implementation Details</u>

UML class diagram to show the dependency between `Command` and `ExpenseList` classes:

![CommandAndExpenseList.png](diagrams%2Fimages%2FCommandAndExpenseList.png)

The following diagram is a UML class diagram for `Expense` and `ExpenseList`:

![ExpenseAndExpenseList.png](diagrams%2Fimages%2FExpenseAndExpenseList.png "UML Class Diagram for Expense and ExpenseList")

### Expense Filter

The `ExpenseFilter` class provides utility methods for selecting expenses based on their category and time range.

Its interaction with `ExpenseList` is demonstrated in the following UML Class Diagram:

![ExpenseListAndFilter.png](diagrams%2Fimages%2FExpenseListAndFilter.png)

`ExpenseFilter` is a prerequisite to implementing other features, e.g. Expense statistics and visualization.

<u>Implementation Details</u>

`ExpenseFilter` filters expenses by 3 criteria: Category, From (date), To (date).
Each criterion is taken care of by a helper method.
Since these filter fields are optional, if they are `null`, helper methods will evaluate to `true`.

Given a list of expenses, `ExpenseFilter` iterates through each expense, applying three criteria checks on them; and 
it would add the expense to a new `ArrayList` if all three checks are satisfied.

The `ArrayList` is then returned to the caller.

### Date and Time Handling

The `DateUtils` class provides utility methods to handle date formatting, validation and conversion. 

The `DateUtils` class has no notable methods.

<u>Implementation Details</u>

The `DateUtils` class is implemented as a Singleton as its methods are common to all other classes that require it.

### Recurring Expense and Recurring Expense List

<u>Overview</u>

The `RecurringExpense` class extends from the `Expense` class and it represents an indivual recurring expense with a price, description, category, last date added and a frequency.

The `RecurringExpenseList` class extends from the `ExpenseList` class and it manages a collection of `RecurringExpense` objects.
It allows for addition, editing and deletion of expenses.

<u>Methods</u>

The `RecurringExpense` class has no notable methods.

The `RecurringExpenseList` class has the following key methods:

|          Method          |                Description                 |
|:------------------------:|:------------------------------------------:|
|  `addRecurringExpense`   |    Adds a recurring expense to the list    |
| `deleteRecurringExpense` | Removes a recurring expense from the list  |
|  `editRecurringExpense`  |   Edits a recurring expense in the list    |
| `loadFromCsv` | Adds the appropriate amount of `Expense` objects with the correct date to the `ExpenseList`|


<u>Design Considerations</u>

Since the programme does not have an auto-save function upon closing the programme or auto-load when starting the programme, it is up to the user to save their work and to load it again.

To minimise the amount of checks that need to be done, the recurring expenses are only added after the user calls the `load` command.

<u>Implementation Details</u>

Below is the UML class diagram for `RecurringExpense` and `RecurringExpenseList`:

![RecurringExpenseAndRecurringExpenseList.png](diagrams%2Fimages%2FRecurringExpenseAndRecurringExpenseList.png "UML Class Diagram for RecurringExpense and RecurringExpenseList class")

Below is the sequence diagram for when the user calls the `load` command.

![RecurringExpenseLoadFromCsvSequence.png](diagrams%2Fimages%2FRecurringExpenseLoadFromCsvSequence.png "UML Sequence Diagram for calling load command")



### Category Package

<u>Overview</u>

The `CategoryFacade` class serves as a higher-level interface that simplifies the interaction with multiple category-related classes (`CategoryTracker`, and `CategoryFilter`). It coordinates the handling of category data and filtering operations, providing a unified API for the rest of the application.

The `CategoryTracker` class manages a collection of Category-`CategoryData` pairs. It allows for the addition, editing and deletion of category-related information.

The `CategoryData` class contains category-related information, namely the cumulative expenditure (the sum of all prices of expenses with that category) and the spending limits for that category. 

The `CategoryFilter` class is responsible for filtering categories based on various criteria, such as those nearing but no yet exceeded their spending limits or those that have exceeded their spending limits. 

<u>Methods</u>

The `CategoryFacade` class has key methods for:

|          Method           |                                                        Description                                                        |
|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|        addCategory        |                Adds a new category and price to the tracker, checking for spending limits after addition.                 |
|      deleteCategory       |                          Deletes a specified category and its associated price from the tracker.                          |
|       editCategory        |   Edits an existing category, updating the old and new category's total expenditures and checking limits after editing.   |
|     loadCategoryInfo      |              Loads category information from a CSV file, tracking categories based on a given expense list.               |
| displayFilteredCategories | Displays filtered categories based on spending limits, showing categories that have exceeded or are nearing their limits. |
|     saveCategoryInfo      |                                   Saves the current category information to a CSV file.                                   |
| setCategorySpendingLimit  |                    Sets a spending limit for a specified category, updating the limit in the tracker.                     |

The `CategoryTracker` class has the following key methods: 

|       Method        |                                                            Description                                                            |
|:-------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|     addCategory     | Adds a new category to the tracker. If already in the tracker, then the total expenditure for that category is increased instead. |
|   deleteCategory    |    Decreases total expenditure of a category. If that total drops to zero or below, the category is removed from the tracker.     |
|    editCategory     |                   Updates the old and new category's total expenditure when an `Expense`'s category is changed.                   |
| setSpendingLimitFor |                                         Sets a spending limit for a particular category.                                          |

The `CategoryData` class has no notable methods.

The `CategoryFilter` class has key methods for:

|          Method           |                                                    Description                                                    |
|:-------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|        initMaxHeap        |              Initialises a custom max heap that sorts categories by their current total expenditure               |
|   getCategoriesFiltered   | Sorts categories in the tracker, which are nearing or have exceeded the designated spending limit, into max-heaps |
| displayFilteredCategories |              Displays the categories in the provided category-filtered max-heap, in a preset format.              |
| displayExceededCategories |                          Displays the categories that have exceeded its spending limits.                          |
| displayNearingCategories  |                 Displays the categories that are nearing, but not exceeded, its spending limits.                  |

After the user adds or edits an `Expense`, it alerts the user if the spending limit is approached or exceeded for that `Expenses`'s category.

After the user loads from file, all categories that have exceeded its designated spending limit will be displayed to the user, followed by all categories that have not exceeded its designated spending limit but are close to it.

<u>Design Considerations</u>

Each of the classes in this package handle a separate concern relating to category management (achieving Separation of Concerns Principle) and each focuses on a specific responsibility (achieving Single Responsibility Principle).

- `CategoryFacade` class
  - Acts as a singleton because only one instance of this exists throughout the program's lifetime. The program passes this instance around through method parameters.
  - Acts as a facade because it provides the Command classes with a unified interface to the underlying category management classes, without the Command classes knowing of the complexity of the interactions between the category-related classes. 
    - This abstracts and encapsulates the category management information with an interface. 
    - This decouples classes outside the package from the classes inside.
  - Acts as a mediator because the category classes access information from the other classes through this class.
    - `CategoryFilter` accesses the tracker in `CategoryTracker` via the instance attribute in `CategoryFacade`.
    - `CategoryStorage` accesses the tracker in `CategoryTracker` via the instance attribute in `CategoryFacade`.
- `CategoryTracker` class
  - Contains exception handling when attempting to edit or delete a category that is not in the tracker. 
  - Uses a hashmap data structure to store `CategoryData` objects, providing quick access and updating of total expenses.
- `CategoryData` class
  - Setter methods checks for null inputs. Constructor methods also do, as they use those setters. 
- `CategoryFilter` class
  -  Uses priority queue data structures as max heaps to sort the category expenditure information

<u>Implementation Details</u>

### Exceptions and Logging

<u>Overview</u>

The program implements Exception handling and Logging with the WheresMyMoneyException and Logging classes.

<u>Implementation Details</u>

WheresMyMoneyException has various children classes, such as `StorageException` and `InvalidInputException`. 
These children classes are meant to provide more information on the error to the developer (beyond the message) such 
that exception handling in the program could be better targetted in the future.

The Logging class is implemented as a Singleton for ease of use. 
Developers can log down certain actions in the program by simply calling the relevant class method `log(Level, String)`.
