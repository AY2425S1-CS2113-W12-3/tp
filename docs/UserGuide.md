## Introduction

WheresMyMoney allows you to keep track of your spending habits and trends with various supporting tools and functionalities.

---

## Quick Start

1. Ensure you have Java 17 or above installed in your computer.
2. Download the latest .jar file from the Github Repository, under releases.
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your expenses.
4. Open a command terminal, cd into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar tp.jar` command to run the application.

## Notes

- Text written in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` are user input fields.
- Text preceded with a `/` are flags that need to be inputted for the programme to recognise.
- When passing in a value with forward slashes (`/`) into an argument, make sure to escape it with `\`:
  - eg. `<command> /argument \/value` -> `argument`: `/value`
- Not all commands will give an output

## FAQ

**Q1**: How do I transfer my data to another computer? 

**A1**: You can save your expenses to a `.csv` file, which you can then transfer and load on another computer 


**Q2**: Can I only update limits (via the set command)? What about adding, deleting or viewing?

**A2**: In short, yes. 

- Adding is automatically done when you add an expense with a category not already stored by the program, defaulted to $100.00. 
- Deletion is not possible as every category will have a corresponding limit. No category can exist without a limit.
- Viewing is not directly possible using commands, only indirectly by saving and viewing the csv file.
